# SpotiSearch

I built this app to consume the spotify api and i applied the best practices

- Destructuring
- ES6
- CSS Grid
- Fetch Browser Api

For styling i use Grid because i want to apply a more pure css, build things on my own and be sure that i can accomplish 
a nice look without any library or framework for this time. For calling the api i use the fetch api because i didnt want to install more package than included in create-react-app,
i want this to be simple and yet very functional.

# Spotify API Authentication
## Implicit Grant

I choose Implicit Grant	because in the test we need to make the authentication as easy as possible. 
That's way i use this authorization.
